The push for digitization and automation of reports is becoming the standard and employers are now looking for candidates with exposure to business intelligence and statistical packages such as Python and Microsoft Power BI.  As such, to improve my analytical skills via machine learning, I am currently pursuing a post graduate certificate in Data Analytics.  This is my final semester as an international student in Canada.

# About Me

I graduated from the University of the West Indies, Mona campus with a Bachelor of Science degree in Statistics along with a minor in Economics.  Since entering the working world, I have worked in the capacity of a research/financial analyst at various levels.  Majority of my career was spent at a small investment firm, Mayberry Investments Limited, where I was responsible for conducting company and business valuations, as well as preparing financial and economic reports to support the revenue departments and the strategic investment decisions of the company. 

In a bid to expand my career, I moved to a larger firm, JMMB Group Limited, in the capacity of a senior analyst, supporting the company’s private and public equity initiative.  This position has given me the opportunity to explore other facets of investment banking while facilitating room for growth, with a key area of focus being the ability to develop interactive reporting dashboards. These reports should be developed not only to track performance, but also to identify opportunities and drive communication that will impact change within the organization.

I prepared the proposal for Mayberry Investments Limited (MIL), which was successful in winning the bid for Wigton.  I also worked closely with the team doing the groundwork for the initial public offer process including: analyses, valuation, preparing informational documents for clients etc. 

The company successfully raised the desired J$5.5 billion.  In fact, the offer was oversubscribed, raising over $14 billion, more than three times the required funding.
