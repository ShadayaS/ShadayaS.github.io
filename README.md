## Accomplishments at Work

## Mayberry Investments Limited
### Wigton Windfarm Tender and Subsequent Listing to the Jamaica Stock Exchange
Wigton Windfarm Limited (WIG) is one of the largest wind energy facilities in the English-speaking Caribbean.  It was previously owned by the government of Jamaica (GOJ) through its energy agency, Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica (PCJ). In 2017, the GOJ announced a potential privatization of WIG and an intention to list on the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE). Local brokers and investment houses were invited to submit tender proposals.

I prepared the proposal for Mayberry Investments Limited (MIL), which was successful in winning the bid for Wigton.  I also worked closely with the team doing the groundwork for the initial public offer process including: analyses, valuation, preparing informational documents for clients etc. 

The company successfully raised the desired J$5.5 billion.  In fact, the offer was oversubscribed, raising over $14 billion, more than three times the required funding.

### Companies Listed on the Jamaica Stock Exchange
During my tenor at Mayberry, from 2010-2020, I was instrumental in the listing of 18 of the 21 companies MIL brought to the market at that time.  2 to the Main market of the JSE and 16 to the Junior market.  These are:

- Lasco Distributors Ltd

### Other Accomplishments
At the time of joining my team at MIL, we were a relatively small research unit, before growing to include investment banking to then a split of the two units. During my tenor, I straddled both units, conducting company valuations, market, and economic research, creating, designing, and implementing new reports among other duties to support all revenue generating departments and provide our clients with timely market information. I was also instrumental in raising over J$20 billion in private debt and equity transactions.

**Some reports designed/created:**

- Local Monthly Economic Report

- Monthly Economic Report – Overseas

- Government Operations Report – This included a review of the revenue and expenditure of the government, analysis of tax measures, impact of measures on the economy etc.

## JMMBSL, JMMB Group Limited
I joined the securities arm of JMMB Group Limited in August 2020 to support the company’s private and public equity initiatives. During my year there some of my accomplishments included:

- I created a model to track the performance of publicly listed companies:

   1. This included creating historical financial statements for each company in analytical format and grouping companies by industry utilizing Microsoft Excel

   2. Utilizing advanced formulas and vba script to run daily reports for each company.  This report included company description, most recent financial performance, and trading performance for that day.


- I created dashboards to track the performance of the company’s equity trading operations and to shows areas needing improvement.  This included:

   1. Revenue generated relative to budget

   2. Report on active client accounts and new accounts being opened

   3. Number of trades being executed and its source (for example via online trading or in branch activities)


- Add value to current valuation model used by the team by implementing different methods of calculating discount rates for valuation purposes as well as including different valuation approaches into template.  This facilitated stress testing of valuation numbers to arrive at a reasonable valuation range for the proposed project at hand.
